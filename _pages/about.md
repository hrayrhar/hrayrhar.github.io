I am a second year PhD student at University of Southern California advised by Prof. [Aram Galstyan](https://www.isi.edu/people/galstyan/about) and Prof. [Greg Ver Steeg](https://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about).
My main research interested is representation learning with the goal of enriching the learned representation with useful properties.
We often express those properties with information-theoretic quantities and propose methods for optimizing such objectives.

More broadly, I am interested in core research in machine learning, understanding/explaining the generalization phenomenon
of deep neural networks, and in estimation/approximation of information-theoretic quantities.
