I am a research scientist at Google Research, where I focus on training efficient and capable language models, particularly smaller ones with up to 10 billion parameters.
My research explores designing novel architectures and training techniques to improve both the quality and efficiency of these models.
More broadly, I am interested in improving in-context learning, long context, length generalization, and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.
At Google, I also worked on developing techniques to extend the context length of language models by over 30 times, contributed to [Gemini Nano](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/nano/) models and YouTube search with state-of-the-art AI techniques.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Aram Galstyan](https://www.isi.edu/people/galstyan/about) and [Greg Ver Steeg](https://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about). My [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15918) was on information stored in neural network weights or activations, and its connections to generalization, memorization, stability and learning dynamics. Prior to USC, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Yerevan State University.
Outside of work, I am interested in reading, cinema, billiards, skiing, chess, music, and philosophy.

  <div class="paper-short-summary">
  Despite the popularity and efficacy of knowledge distillation, there is limited understanding of why it helps. In order to study the generalization behavior of a distilled student, we propose a new theoretical framework that leverages supervision complexity: a measure of alignment between teacher-provided supervision and the student's neural tangent kernel. The framework highlights a delicate interplay among the teacher's accuracy, the studentâ€™s margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of the teacher predictions. Specifically, it provides a rigorous justification for the utility of various techniques that are prevalent in the context of distillation, such as early stopping and temperature scaling. Our analysis further suggests the use of online distillation, where a student receives increasingly more complex supervision from teachers in different stages of their training. We demonstrate efficacy of online distillation and validate the theoretical findings on a range of image classification benchmarks and model architectures.

  Some of the tightest information-theoretic generalization bounds depend on the average information between the learned hypothesis and a <i>single</i> training example. However, these sample-wise bounds were derived only for <i>expected</i> generalization gap. We show that even for expected <i>squared</i> generalization gap no such sample-wise information-theoretic bounds exist. The same is true for PAC-Bayes and single-draw bounds. Remarkably, PAC-Bayes, single-draw and expected squared generalization gap bounds that depend on information in pairs of examples exist.

  <div class="paper-short-summary">
  We propose an evaluation framework for domain generalization algorithms that allows decomposition of the test error into components capturing distinct aspects of generalization. We show that the largest contributor to the generalization error varies across methods, datasets, regularization strengths and even training lengths. We observe two problems associated with the strategy of learning domain-invariant representations. On Colored MNIST, most domain generalization algorithms fail because they reach domain-invariance only on the training domains. On Camelyon-17, domain-invariance degrades the quality of representations on unseen domains. We hypothesize that focusing instead on tuning the classifier on top of a rich representation can be a promising direction.

  We derive information-theoretic generalization bounds for supervised learning algorithms based on the information contained in predictions rather than in the output of the training algorithm. These bounds improve over the existing information-theoretic bounds, are applicable to a wider range of algorithms, and solve two key challenges: (a) they give meaningful results for deterministic algorithms and (b) they are significantly easier to estimate. We show experimentally that the proposed bounds closely follow the generalization gap in practical scenarios for deep learning.

  <div class="paper-short-summary">
  We define a notion of information that an individual sample provides to the training of a neural network, and we specialize it to measure both how much a sample informs the final weights and how much it informs the function computed by the weights.
  Though related, we show that these quantities have a  qualitatively different behavior.
  We give efficient approximations of these quantities using a linearized network and demonstrate empirically that the approximation is accurate for real-world architectures, such as pre-trained ResNets.
  We apply these measures to several problems, such as dataset summarization, analysis of under-sampled classes, comparison of informativeness of different data sources, and detection of adversarial and corrupted examples.

  <div class="paper-short-summary">
  In the presence of noisy or incorrect labels, neural networks have the undesirable tendency to memorize information about the noise.
  We show that one can prevent memorization and improve generalization by controlling the Shannon mutual information between weights and the vector of all training labels given inputs, I(w ; y âˆ£ x).
  To minimize this information, we propose training algorithms that employ an auxiliary network that predicts gradients in the final layers of a classifier without accessing labels.
  Our approach yields drastic improvements over standard training algorithms (like cross-entropy
  loss), and outperform competitive approaches designed for learning with noisy labels.

  We introduce a method, called linear CorEx, for learning latent factors such that the joint probability distribution

  The method has linear complexity w.r.t. the number of observed variables and works 
  well in high-dimensional undersampled regimes.
  Furthermore, when the data comes from an approximately modular Gaussian latent factor model,
  linear CorEx exhibits blessing of dimensionality!

  In this work we extend linear CorEx to work with temporal data.
  The main method -- T-CorEx --  takes multivariate time series, divided into time periods and 
  models the data of each time period with an instance of linear CorEx, such that the models
  vary smoothly over time.
  The method can be used for estimating covariance matrix of observed variables at each time period, clustering of time
  series, change point detection, and extracting useful information.
  All these analyses can be done in less than an hour even when the data is truly high-dimensional 
  (like an fMRI instance with 10^5 variables and 20 time periods).

  The progress in machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets.
  To address this problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from the publicly available MIMIC-III database.
  These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and phenotype classification.
  We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models.

  <div class="paper-short-summary">
  If the factors comprising a representation allow us to make accurate predictions about our system, 
  but obscuring any subset of the factors destroys our ability to make predictions, we say that the 
  representation exhibits informational synergy. We argue that synergy is an undesirable feature in 
  learned representations and that explicitly minimizing synergy can help disentangle the true factors 
  of variation underlying data. We explore different ways of quantifying synergy, deriving new 
  closed-form expressions in some cases, and then show how to modify learning to produce representations 
  that are minimally synergistic. We introduce a benchmark task to disentangle separate characters from images 
  of words. We demonstrate that Minimally Synergistic (MinSyn) representations correctly disentangle characters while 
  methods relying on statistical independence fail.
